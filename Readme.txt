This is my code for a pygame interface to the Freenove smart car:
http://www.freenove.com/
https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_Three-wheeled_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi

To run the code, simply copy the python to your raspberry pi, and then over XRDP or VNC:
$ python3 main_v1.py

The code is GPLv3 so feel free to modify, and share.

More features planned, as I think of them.
Enjoy!

Update: I now have an associated blog, where I discuss my code: https://thesmartcarproject.blogspot.com.au/
